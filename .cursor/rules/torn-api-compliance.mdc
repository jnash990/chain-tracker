# Torn API Compliance

This project uses the Torn City API. All code must comply with [Torn's API documentation](https://www.torn.com/api.html) and [scripting rules](https://www.torn.com/rules.php).

## Core Rules

1. **API key only** – Never request passwords. Only the 16-character API key.
2. **Keep keys and data secure** – Store confidentially; never share unless permitted by the key owner.
3. **Minimize requests** – Request only the selections needed. Avoid redundant or unnecessary calls.
4. **Rate limits** – Max 100 requests/minute per user across all keys. Use a rolling window and back off on error 5 or HTTP 429.
5. **Invalid keys** – Remove or clear disabled/invalid keys on error. Multiple requests with bad keys can cause IP bans.
   - Clear key on error codes: 2 (Incorrect Key), 12 (Key read error), 13 (Owner inactivity), 18 (Key paused).
6. **ToS disclosure** – Where users enter their API key, clearly state: data storage, data sharing, purpose, key storage, required access level.

## Error Codes (relevant)

- 2: Incorrect Key
- 5: Too many requests (retry after delay)
- 8: IP block (from abuse)
- 12: Key read error
- 13: Key disabled (owner inactive 7+ days)
- 16: Key access level insufficient
- 18: Key paused by owner

## ToS (this app)

- Data stored only in the user's browser (IndexedDB).
- Key stored locally; never sent except to api.torn.com.
- Required access: Limited (chain + faction news/armory).
